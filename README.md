## üåü Features

### 1. **Drawing Functionality**

- **LineString Drawing**:

  - Draw routes with multiple waypoints.
  - Press the **Enter** key to complete the LineString.
  - Features visual representation with **blue lines**, **arrows**, and **dots**.
  - Displays real-time distance calculations between points.

- **Polygon Drawing**:
  - Create polygons with multiple vertices.
  - Press the **Enter** key to complete the polygon.
  - Features visual representation with **orange dotted lines**.
  - Displays automatic perimeter distance calculations.

### 2. **Interactive Modals**

- **Mission Modal**:

  - Displays waypoint coordinates and distances.
  - Supports expandable/collapsible sections for polygons.
  - Updates dynamically during drawing.
  - Coordinates displayed in decimal format.
  - Distance displayed in meters.

- **Polygon Modal**:
  - Displays polygon waypoints and distances.
  - Coordinates displayed in N/S format.
  - Import functionality for adding polygons to missions.

### 3. **Polygon Integration**

- Insert polygons before/after any LineString point.
- Visual connections between LineStrings and Polygons:
  - **Single Line** for connections at endpoints.
  - **Two Lines** for connections to midpoints.
- Maintains consistent distance calculations with proper coordinate transformations.

### 4. **User Interface**

- **"Draw" Button** to initiate drawing mode.
- Intuitive modal interfaces for managing data.
- **Three-dot Menu** for polygon insertion options.
- Responsive map interactions for seamless navigation.
